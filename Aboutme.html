         So my Name is Kunal verma and I am a Engineer .I completed my graduation in 2021 as a Computer science Engineer from KR MANGALAM University.
         So like most of the Engineers or at least some of them I didnâ€™t figure out what I wanted to do or maybe I was unable to find my field of interest.
         So initially I started my journey by learning Data Science and soon I realized that it was Something I was not interested in. So after wasting months
          of my time that too in my final year I came to know about the job opportunities in Web-Development and so I started my journey yet again and for the 
          First time I was finding coding interesting and fun to implement.
         And so I decided to peruse it with all my efforts. It has been fun until now and I am hoping to have a better journey ahead.
